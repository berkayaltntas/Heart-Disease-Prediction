# EEE-485-Term-Project
## Introduction
This is the term project for the **EEE 485 Statistical Learning and Data Analytics** course. The project focuses on predicting heart disease using and coding machine learning algorithms from scratch, including **Logistic Regression**, **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, and **Decision Trees**. It aims to evaluate the performance of different supervised learning models on the **Heart Disease Cleveland UCI dataset** from Kaggle, containing 297 samples and 13 key features related to cardiovascular health.


## Core Achievements
- Developed a machine learning-based system to predict heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Cleveland dataset, applying **logistic regression**, **MLP**, and **decision tree** algorithms.
- Preprocessed data using **standardization**, **one-hot encoding**, and **correlation analysis** to improve model accuracy and generalization.
- Applied **k-fold cross-validation** for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing **learning rates**, **epoch sizes**, and **network architectures**.
- Built the entire machine learning pipeline from **data preprocessing** to **model training and evaluation**, utilizing key Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
